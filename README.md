# 🏔️ where to go 🏔️
map of hiking destinations with info to help choose your destination
- hike distance
- drive time
- weather forecast
- smoke forecast

## desired end state
- hike popups: drive time, 5-day outlook for weather and smoke
- map display: change symbols based on drop-down of metrics

## to do
- break down weather and smoke forecasts
- add more hikes

### ☀️ desired smoke/weather metrics ⛈️
- convert utc times to local day
- calculate average aqi for the day
- calculate high/low for the day
- percent of day with possible rain?? doesn't capture intensity
- [possible weather codes](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)

## nice to have
- enter launch pad coordinates from within map
- if a metric is not being used for display, don't fetch it until its popup is activated
- host somewhere to make accessible to the global web

## tech stack
- [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [openweather api](https://openweathermap.org)
