- smoke forecast

## ⭕ prerequisites
- python web server (see `requirements.txt`)
- your own tokens on `openweather` and `mapbox gl js`
  - the tokens should be stored in `tokens.py` in the same directory as `main.py`:
  ```python
  tokens = {
    "mapbox": "your_mapbox_token",
    "openweather": "your_openweather_token"
  }
  ```

## ☑️ to do
