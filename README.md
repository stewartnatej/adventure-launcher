# 🏔️ where to go 🏔️
🗺️ map of hiking destinations with info to help choose your destination 🗺️
- hike distance
- drive time
- weather forecast
- smoke forecast

## 🤔 desired end state 🤔
- hike popups: drive time, 5-day outlook for weather and smoke
- map display: change symbols based on drop-down of metrics

## ☑️ to do ☑️
- break down weather and smoke forecasts
- add more hikes

### 🌦️ desired smoke/weather metrics 🌦️
- convert utc times to local day
- calculate average aqi for the day
- calculate high/low for the day
- percent of day with possible rain?? doesn't capture intensity
- [possible weather codes](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)

## 🤗 nice to have 🤗
- enter launch pad coordinates from within map
- if a metric is not being used for display, don't fetch it until its popup is activated
- host somewhere to make accessible to the global web
